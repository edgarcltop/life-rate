Roadmap Generator
-----------------

A Roadmap as Code (RaC) Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roadmap Generator is a python library used to draw roadmap by using python code. This is the first Roadmap as Code (RaC) library. RaC helps to create and edit roadmap in a more efficient way without having to use any graphical tools that are not always easy to use to create or update a roadmap.

With git repository like GitHub or Bitbucket, roadmaps created using RaC tool can be version controlled, track changes and can be easily shared with others.
